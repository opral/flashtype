Flashtype is a WYSIWYG markdown editor built on the Lix SDK. It serves as both a showcase for Lix's capabilities and a real-world application that drives the SDK's development—proving that embeddable version control enables powerful features like AI-assisted editing, change proposals, and full document history, all running entirely in the browser.

## 🎯 What This Demonstrates

| Lix Feature             | How Flashtype Uses It                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **History**             | Every edit is tracked. See exactly what changed, when, and by whom.           |
| **Versions (Branches)** | AI generates content in isolated versions, letting you review before merging. |
| **Diffs**               | Claude Code-style accept/reject UI shows granular changes inline.             |
| **Change Proposals**    | AI proposes edits, humans stay in control of what ships.                      |
| **Single SQLite File**  | Your documents persist in browser storage as a portable `.lix` file.          |
